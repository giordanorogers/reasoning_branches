["initializing"]Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular (0, 3) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. Let me try to recall the formulas for this conversion.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]First, I find r, which is the radial from the origin to the point (x, y). The think the formula is r = sqrt(x² + y²). That, that sounds right because it's like the Pythagorean theorem.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, pl this case, the point is (0, 3), so x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging those into the formula, r should be √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = That simplifies to 3. Okay, so r is 3. That part seems straightforward.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Now, the tricky part is be finding θ. the angle. I remember that θ can be found using the arctangent function because tangent is θ is equal to y over x. So, θ = arctan(y/x).["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]But wait, in this case, x is 0. so y/x would be 3/0, Oh, division by zero is undefined. That means be a problem. I need to think about this happens when x is 0.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]I remember when x is 0, the point lies somewhere the y-axis. So, in polar coordinates, that should correspond to an angle of either π/2 or 3π/2, depending on whether y is positive or negative.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Since this case, y is 3, which is positive, so the angle should be π/2 radians. That makes sense because π/2 is is 90 degrees, which points straight up along the positive y-axis.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Let me double verify that. If I is π/2, then the point in polar coordinates would (3, π/2). Converting that to rectangular coordinates, give me (r*cosθ, r*sinθ). So, plugging in r that would be (3*cos(π/2), 3*sin(π/2)). Cos(π/2) is 0 and sin(π/2) is 1, so that gives me (0, 3), which is the original point. Perfect, that checks out.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Wait, just to make thorough, are there another other angle that could also give me the same point?["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Well, in in polar coordinates are typically measured from positive x-axis and can go around the circle multiple times, but since we're asked to 0 ≤ θ < 2π, π/2 is the only angle in that interval that points to up along y-axis.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, putting it all together, the is 3 and θ is π/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). I think that's the correct answer.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Just to recap the steps:
1. Calculate r using r = √(x² + y²). For (0, 3), that's √(0 + 9) = 3.
2. Determine θ. Since x is 0 and y is positive, θ is π/2.
3. Verify them and θ to get the polar coordinates (3, π/2).["end-section"]

["deduction"]I, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that when x is 0, the angle is on the y-axis, so the angle is be π/2 or positive y and If y were negative, it would be 3π/2, but in this case, it's positive, so π/2 is correct.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]I guess remember to verify by conversion by plugging back into the rectangular coordinates, which is me the original point. That gives me confidence that my did it right.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, I think I'm all here. The polar coordinates for (3, π/2).

 I'll write that as the final answer.

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.["end-section"]
