["initializing"]Okay, so I have this function f(x) = (3x - 2)\/(x - 2), and I need to find the sum of f(-2), f(-1), and f(0). Hmm, let me think this down step by step. IFirst,, I should probably that to find f(a), I just substitute x with a in the function. So, I each of these values (- I'll plug them into the(x) and compute. Let's start with f(-2).["end-section"]

["deduction"]Calcul x is -2, the function becomes f(-2) = (3*(-2) - 2]\\/[-2 - 2]. Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately to 

 numerator is 3*(-2) which is -6, minus 2 is so that's -8. The denominator is -2 - 2, which is -4. So,(-2) is (-8)\/(-4). Hmmiding two negatives gives a positive, so that's 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2. That wasn straightforward.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Next, is f(-1). Plugging x x = -1, the function, we get f(-1) = [3*(-1) - 2]\/[-1 - 2]. Again, let's compute numerator and denominator separately. Numerator: 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -5. Denominator: -1 - 2 is -3. So f(-1) is (-5)\/(-3). Again, negatives cancel out, so that's 5\/3.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Hmm, 's a fraction. I'll to remember that when5\/3 is approximately 1.666..., but since the question asks for a common fraction, I'll keep it as 5\/3.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Now, moving on to f(0). Plstituting x = 0 into f function, f(0) = [3*0 - 2]\/[0 - 2]. Letator: 3*0 is 0, minus 2 is -2. Denominator: 0 - 2 is -2. So f(0) is (-2)\/(-2), which is 1. That enough.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Now, I need to add these three results together: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + 5\/3 + 1. Let me compute this. First, 2 + 1 is 3. Then, 3 + 5\/3. Hmm, to3 is the same as 9\/3, so 9\/3 + 5\/3 is 14\/3.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]SoWait, let me double sure I did that correctly.["end-section"]

["deduction"]2 is 2\/1,  to add 2\/ 5\/3, I need a common denominator. which is 3. So 2 is 6\/3, and 6\/3 + 5\/3 is 11\/3. Then, 1, which is 3\/3, so 11\/3 + 3\/3 is 14\/3. Yeah, that's correct.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, putting(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) equals 14\/3. Let, 14 divided by 3 is about 4 and 2\/3, but since the question asks for a common fraction, 14\/3 is the a common fraction, so that think that's the answer.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Let to double-check, let me go through each step again quickly1. f(-2): [3*(-2) - 2]\/[-2 - 2] = (-6 - 2)\/(-4) = (-8)\/(-4) = 2. Correct.
2. f(-1): [3*(-1) - 2]\/[-1 - 2] = (-3 - 2)\/(-3) = (-5)\/(-3) = 5\/3. Correct.

3. f(0): [3*0 - 2]\/[0 - 2] = (-2)\/(-2) = 1. Correct.

Adding: 2 + 5\/3 + 1. 3 + 5\/3 = 14\/3. Yep, that's right.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]I, hold thinking, the function f f(x) = (3x - 2)\/(x - 2). Is there any chanceification I alternative form that might make this easier?["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Let me see:

I can try to perform polynomial division or see the numerator. Let's see, 3x - 2. Hmm, the I factor to write it as 3(x - 2) + something. Let's compute:

3(x - 2) = 3x - 6. So, 3x - 2 is 3(x - 2) + 4. So, f(x) can [3(x - 2) + 4]\/(x - 2) = 3 + 4\/(x - 2). 

Oh, that's interesting. So f f(x) can be rewritten as 3 + 4\/(x - 2). Maybe that form is make computing f(-2), f(-1), f f(0) easier?["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Let me try that.

For. f(-2): 3 + 4\/(-2 - 2) = 3 + 4\/(-4) = 3 - 1 = 2. Same result before.

2. f(-1): 3 + 4\/(-1 - 2) = 3 + 4\/(-3) = 3 - 4\/3. Hmm, 3 is 9\/3, so 9\/3 - 4\/3 = 5\/3. Same.

3. f(0): 3 + 4\/(0 - 2) = 3 + 4\/(-2) = 3 - 2 = 1. Correct.

So, same results. So them up: 2 + 5\/3 + 1 = 14\/3. So, same's it earlier calculation.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]I, maybe I can compute if approach, like as pl a general expression for f(a) and a is not of these x-values, but I think the might complicate things more. necessary. Since each substitution is straightforward, and them individually seems probably the simplest way.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Just, just thought: since f these x are being, maybe I can compute each f step by step without rewriting the function. but is essentially what I did. So, I think my way is solid.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Just to make sure, let me compute each function(x) again:

1. f(-2): numerator3*(-2) - 2]\/[-2 - 2] = (-6 - 2)\/(-4) = (-8)\/(-4) = 2.

 Correct.

2. f(-1): [3*(-1) - 2]\/[-1 - 2] = (-3 - 2)\/(-3) = (-5)\/(-3) = 5\/3. Correct.

3. f(0): [3*0 - 2]\/[0 - 2] = (-2)\/(-2) = 1. Correct.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Adding them: 2 + 5\/3 + 1. Let me convert all terms with denominator 3:

2 = 6\/3, 5\/3 is the and 1 is 3\/3. So, 6\/3 + 5\/3 + 3\/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)\/3 = 14\/3. Yep, that result.["end-section"]

["deduction"]I think I've verified-checked enough. The seems that step is correct and correct. So, the final answer is 14\/3.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{14}{3}}.["end-section"]
