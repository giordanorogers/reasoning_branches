I'll split this reasoning chain into annotated parts with the specified labels:

["initializing"]Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, ) to polar coordinates. Hmm, okay. I me remember how polar coordinates work. Polar think polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made from the positive x-axis to 

?["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]First, I need find recall the value of r. I recall that the formula for r is terms coordinates is r on the Pythagorean theorem. So, if I have a point (x, y) in rectangular coordinates, then r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). Let me write that down:

r = √(x² + y²)["end-section"]

["deduction"]In the point (0,3), x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging those into into the formula:

r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3

Okay, so r is 3. That seems straightforward.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Now, onto finding θ. θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis, and it's usually measured in radians. I remember that θ formula for θ is the arctangent of y over x, so:

θ = arctan(y/x)["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]But wait, in this case, x is 0. So,ugging in the values:

θ = arctan(3/0)

Hmm, hold on. Dividing by zero is undefined. That, what does that mean?["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]I think when x is 0, the point lies somewhere on the y-axis. So on whether y is positive or negative, θ angle will be either π/2 or 3π/2 radians["end-section"]

["deduction"]Since our y is is 3, which is positive, the point should be π/2 radians["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Let me verify that. In x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis, which is at 90 degrees or π/2 radians from the positive x-axis. So, θ should π/2.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Wait, but me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, dependingctan can be tricky because it has a range from -π/2 to π/2, but in this coordinates, θ can go from 0 to 2π. So, if x were use arctan(y/x), I might not always get the correct angle, the point is in a different quadrant.["end-section"]

["deduction"]But in this case, since x is 0, it point is on the y-axis, so it's either π/2 or 3π/2. Since y is positive, it's π/2.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, putting it all together, r polar coordinates should be (3, π/2).["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Let just me double this to make sure. In point (0,3) is straight the y-axis, three units up from the origin. In, if I imagine the polar coordinate system, starting from the origin x-axis, rotating π/2 radians (which is 90 degrees) count me straight up to the positive y-axis. That the distance from the origin is 3, so that makes.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Is there any way to check-check this?["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Maybe by converting back to rectangular coordinates. If I have ( coordinates (3, π/2), then convert back to rectangular, the formulas are:

x = r cos θ

y = r sin θ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]So, plugging in r = 3 and θ = π/2:

x = 3 cos(π/2) = 3 * 0 = 0

y = 3 sin(π/2) = 3 * 1 = 3

Which gives us (0,3), the original point. Perfect, that that checks out.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]I, just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or When x is 0, the arctangent is undefined, but in can determine θ angle based on the sign of y. Since y is positive, it know it's in the upper half of the coordinate system, specifically on the positive y-axis, which is π π/2. If y were negative, it would be 3π/2.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, that makes seems solid.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Another thing: sometimes, calculators or computers might give θ in degrees, but since the problem specifies  use θ between 0 and 2π, it is in radians, I/2 is appropriate here.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, just all that, I think confident that the polar coordinates for (3, π/2).["end-section"]

["example-testing"]I to recap:

1. Calculate r using r(x² + y²) = √3.
2. Determine θ since on the position of the point. Since x=0 and y>0, θ=π/2.
3. Verify by converting back to rectangular coordinates, ensure it matches correct.

Yep, that all adds up.["end-section"]

["deduction"]I don't think I made any mistakes here the reasoning. It's sense because the0,3) is a straightforward point on the y-axis, so its polar form shouldn't be complicated.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]I last thing: sometimes, people get confuse the angle when the is negative or when, but in this case, x x is zero, it's simpler clear.'s either straight up or straight down. So y is positive, it up is π/2.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Alright, I think I'm satisfied with that solution.

 It seems pretty, and all verification back works perfectly so I gives a good sign.

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.["end-section"]
