["initializing"]Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. Let me think about how to calculate r and θ.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]First, let think recall the formulas for converting from rectangular (xesian) coordinates ( polar coordinates. I I have a point (x, y), then the radius r can be found using the formula:

r = √(x² + y²)

And the angle θ can be found using:

θ = arctan(y / x)["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]But wait, I also therectan might give me the wrong angle sometimes because it depends on the quadrant where the point is located. So, I should use the arctangent function with two arguments, arctan2(y, x), which get the correct angle. But, since I'm doing this manually, I need to figure out the angle based on the position of the point.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Looking at the point (0, 3), the x-coordinate is 0 and the y-coordinate is 3. So, point is on the positive y-axis, In should help me figure out the angle θ["end-section"]

["deduction"]Let me calculate by calculating r. Plugging the the formula:

r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3

Okay, r is 3. That makes sense because the point is 3 units away the origin on the y-axis.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Now, for the angle θ. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, I angle the angle there standard position (measured from the positive x-axis)? I remember that the positive y-axis is at 90 degrees or π/2 radians from the positive x-axis. So, should be π/2.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]But wait, let me double if the formula. = arctan(y / x). If this case, x is 3 and x is 0. so we have looking to compute arctan(3 / 0). Hmm, division by zero is undefined. That's why I can have the position of the point instead of["end-section"]

["deduction"]Since x is 0 and the point is on the y-axis, so the is either π/2 or 3π/2. But y is positive, it's π/2.

 not 3π/2.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, θ is π/2 radians["end-section"]

["deduction"]Putting it all together, the polar coordinates should be (3, π/2).["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Let me just visualize this to make sure. Starting from the origin, moving 3 units at an angle of π/2 radians (which is straight up along the y-axis) lands me at (0, 3). Yep seems correct.["end-section"]

["deduction"]I don't think I made any mistakes here. The radius is straightforward, and the the point is on the y-axis, the angle is definitely π/2. So need to adjust for angle for different quadrants or it's already on the axis.

So, yeah, I'm confident that the polar coordinates for (3, π/2).

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.["end-section"]
