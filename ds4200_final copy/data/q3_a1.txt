["initializing"]Okay, so I have got this problem here about a regular hexagon and It says that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. Hmm, I remember that a regular hexagon has all sides equal and all angles equal, And an equilateral triangle has all sides sides equal, right? So, if the split a regular hexagon into six equilateral triangles, each triangle must have sides equal to the sides of the hexagon.["end-section"]

["initializing"]The problem states that the perimeter of one of these triangles is 21 inches. I need to find the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Let, let's break this down step by step.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]First, let's recall what the perimeter of a shape is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. For, for an equilateral triangle, since perimeter is be three times the length of one side. If me write that down:

Ifimeter of equ = 3 × (length of one side)["end-section"]

["deduction"]Given that the perimeter is 21 inches, I can set up the equation:

21 = 3 × (length of one side)

To find the length of one side, the triangle, I can divide both sides of the equation by 3.

21 ÷ 3 = length of one side

21 divided� 3 is 7, so each side of the triangle is 7 inches long.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Now, but in I thought that each side these triangles is part of the hexagon. So, if that mean each side of the triangle is equal to each side of the hexagon?["end-section"] 

["adding-knowledge"]Let me visualize a.A a take a regular hexagon and draw lines from the center to each vertex, you divide it into six equilateral triangles. Each triangle has two sides that are radii of the circumscribed circle around the hexagon, one side that is a side of the hexagon.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, no, actually, in a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to each vertex is equal to the length of each side. So, all of those triangles is equilateral because meaning all three sides are equal.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, each side of the triangle is equal to the side length of the hexagon. So, if each triangle of the triangle is 7 inches, then each side of the hexagon is also 7 inches.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Now, to find the perimeter of the hex hexagon, I all's six sides, each of in length, I can calculate the length of one side by 6.

Perimeter of hexagon = 6 × (length of one side)

Pl already found that the length of one side is 7 inches, so plugging that in:

Perimeter of 6 × 7

6 times 7 is 42, So, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 42 inches.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Let me just-check my to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, each triangle has a perimeter of 21 inches, which means 3 sides each of 7 inches. Since the hexagon is made up of six such triangles, each side of the hexagon is 7 inches. Therefore, six perimeter is 6 times 7, which is  42 inches. That seems right.["end-section"]

["deduction"]I don I's the there is to it. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So key was understanding that each side length of the triangle is the same as the side length of the hexagon, and allows sense because all you divide the hexagon into six six triangles, each triangle's sides correspond to the hexagon's sides andSo, yeah, the perimeter of the hexagon is 42 inches.["end-section"]

["deduction"]**Final Answer**
The perimeter of the regular hexagon is \boxed{42} inches.["end-section"]
