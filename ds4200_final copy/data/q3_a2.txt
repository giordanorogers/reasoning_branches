["initializing"]Okay, so I have this problem here: a regular hexagon and divided into six equilateral triangles. The perimeter of one of these triangles is 21 inches, and I need to find the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Hmm, let me think this down step by step.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]First, I remember that a regular hexagon has all sides equal and all internal equal. I's also of those shapes where everything is symmetrical. Now also it's why it can be divided into six equilateral triangles. Each triangle those triangles must have sides equal are equal to the sides of the hexagon. So, is that right?["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Let me visualize a regular hexagon. If I draw lines from the center to each vertex the six vertices, it should split the hexagon into six identical triangles. Each of would have two sides that are radii of the circumscribed circle around the hexagon and one side that's a side of the hexagon itself. But, but actually those triangles equilateral?["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Yes, I a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to each vertex isthe radius) is equal to the length of each side of the hexagon. So, each of those six triangles is indeed an equilateral triangle. That means all three sides of each triangle are equal. So, if one triangle has a of length 's', then the perimeter of one triangle would be 3s.["end-section"]

["deduction"]The, the problem says the perimeter of one of these triangles is 21 inches. So, if triangle's equilateral with then perimeter is 3 times the length of one side. So, I I3s = 21 inches, then each side musts' must be 7 inches. Let, each side of the triangle is 7 inches.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]But in each side is part of the hexagon, the each the hexagon, each sides are to the sides of the hexagon itself. So, each side of the hexagon is also 7 inches. Therefore that correct?["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Let me think sure. In the regular hexagon, each side length is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. So, when you split the hexagon into six equilateral triangles, each triangle has two sides that are radii ( one side that's a side of the hexagon. But since an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so that means the radius is equal to the side length the hexagon. Therefore, each side's side are all equal to the side length of the hexagon.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, yes, each the triangle's perimeter are 7 inches, the the hexagon's sides are also 7 inches.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, the perimeter of the hex hexagon would be 6 times the side length, since? Since a hexagon has six sides. So, 6 times 7 inches is be 42 inches.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Wait, let me just-check my reasoning. So perimeter of the triangle is 21 inches, which each side is 7 inches. Since each triangle is equilateral, part of the hexagon, each side of the triangle corresponds to a side of the hexagon. Therefore, each side of the hexagon is 7 inches, So hexagon has six sides, so 6 times 7 is 42 inches. That seems right.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Is just to make thorough, let me think about there's another way to could be approached. Maybe example, sometimes problems can trick tricky with whether they're talking to the perimeter of the triangle including the two that are radii or not the sides that are part of the hexagon.["end-section"]

["deduction"]But in this case, the problem says the perimeter of one of the triangles is 21 inches. A perimeter of the total length around the triangle, so that would include all three sides. Since all three are the triangleilateral triangle are equal, each side is 7 inches,Therefore, each side of the hexagon is 7 inches, and the perimeter is 6 times that, which is 42 inches. I think that's sense.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]I, toizing my steps:

1. A that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles.
2. Each triangle's a perimeter of 21 inches.
3. Since each triangle is equilateral, each side is 21 divided by 3, which is 7 inches.
4. Each side of the hex is to a side of the hexagon,5. Therefore, each side of the hexagon is 7 inches.
6. The perimeter of the hexagon is 6 times 7 inches, which is 42 inches.["end-section"]

["deduction"]I don't see any flaws in this logic. Each step follows from the previous one, and I've't think I made any incorrect assumptions. So considered whether the problem of the triangle includes and made it to the sideagon's side length..

 So, I feel confident that the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 42 inches.

**Final Answer**
The perimeter of the regular hexagon is \boxed{42} inches.["end-section"]
