["initializing"]Okay, so I have this problem here: a regular hexagon and It says that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. Hmm the perimeter of one of the triangles is 21 inches, what need to find the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]First, I me visualize a regular hexagon. I regular hexagon has all equal sides and six equal angles. I, the problem mentions it can be divided into six equilateral triangles. I, I, so if I imagine drawing lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its six, it should split the hexagon into six identical equilateral triangles. That triangle would have two sides that are radii of the circagon and one side that's a side of the hexagon itself.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Wait each the triangles are equilateral, that means all their sides are equal. So, each side has have three equal to the radius of the hexagon and Wait, but in a regular hexagon, the radius is equal to the length of its side. Is that right? Let me think.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]In a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to any vertex is equal same as the length of each side. So,, the of those trianglesilateral triangles has sides equal to the side length of the hexagon.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, if each triangle is equilateral, has a perimeter of 21 inches, I can find the length of one side of the triangle. which will be the to the side length of the hexagon. Then, since the hexagon has six sides, each of that length, I can multiply by six to get the perimeter of the hexagon.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Alright me write that down. The perimeter of one equilateral triangle is 21 inches. Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, each side must be 21 divided by 3. So, 21 divided by 3 is 7. Therefore, each side of the triangle is 7 inches..["end-section"]

["deduction"]But wait, each side of the triangle is equal to the side length of the hexagon. So, the hexagon has sides of are  7 inches long. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon, 6 times 7 inches. Let me calculate that: 6 times 7 is 42. So, the perimeter of the regularagon is be 42 inches.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Wait, let me double sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistake. So, the hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles, Each triangle has a perimeter of 21 inches. so each side is 7 inches. Since each side of the triangle is equal side of the hexagon, the hexagon's side is is 7 inches. Therefore, the perimeteragon has six sides, so 6 times 7 is 42 inches. That, that seems right.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Is there another way to think about this? Maybe in considering the relationship between the triangle's perimeter and the hexagon's perimeter. Let's see. each hex of the triangle is 21 inches, and is three sides each of 7 inches. Since of those sides corresponds to a side of the hexagon. but in side of the hexagon is shared by two triangles, right?["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, no on, no that correct? If, no you divide the hexagon into six equ, each triangle has one side that's a side of the hexagon, and the other two sides are internali of the hexagon.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]But in a regular hexagon, the radius is equal to the side length. So, each this triangle, all three sides are equal to the side length of the hexagon.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, each triangle's perimeter is three times the side length ofTherefore, if the triangle's perimeter is 21 inches, then side is 7 inches, which the hexagon's side is 7 inches, Then, the hexagon's perimeter is six times that, which is 42 inches.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Wait, so earlier initial thought was correct. Each key length of the hexagon is 7 inches, so the is 42 inches. I, I think that's the answer.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]But just to make-check, let me think about the structure again. A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles by each with side length equal to the hexagon's side. So, each triangle's perimeter is 3 times, where s is the side length. So 3s = 21, then s = 7. Then, the hexagon's perimeter is 6s = 42. Yep, that's consistent.["end-section"]

["deduction"]I don I'm got it. So, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 42 inches.

**Final Answer**
The perimeter of the regular hexagon is \boxed{42} inches.["end-section"]
