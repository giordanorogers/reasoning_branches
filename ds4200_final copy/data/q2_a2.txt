["initializing"]Okay, so I have to find the value of f f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) where the function is given by \( f(x) = \frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \). Hmm, let me think to figure this out step by step.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]First, I remember I should calculate each of these function individually and then add them up. That seems sense because each I try find each \( f(-2) \), \( f(-1) \), and \( f(0) \), separately, adding them together should give me the answer.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Starting with \( f(-2) \). To find this, I substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function. So, pl's plug that:

\( f(-2) = \frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} \)

Calculating the numerator first: \( 3(-2) =) is \( -6 \), and then subtracting 2 gives \( -6 - 2 = -8 \).

 

 the denominator: \( -2 - 2 = -4 \). So, it together,\( f(-2) = \frac{-8}{-4} \)

Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so \( \8 \/4 = 2 \). So, \( f(-2) = 2 \). That seems straightforward.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Next, let on to \( f(-1) \). Again, substit \( x = -1 \) into the function:

\( f(-1) = \frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} \)

Calculating the numerator: \( 3(-1) = -3 \), subtract 2 gives \( -3 - 2 = -5 \). The denominator: \( -1 - 2 = -3 \). So:

\( f(-1) = \frac{-5}{-3} \)

Again, negatives cancel out, so this simplifies to \( \frac{5}{3} \). So, \( f(-1) = \frac{5}{3} \).["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Got, that's a fraction, so I need need to handle careful when adding them all later.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Now, onto \( f(0) \). Substitute \( x = 0 \):

\( f(0) = \frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} \)

Calculumerator: \( 3(0) = 0 \), subtract 2 gives \( -2 \). Denominator: \( 0 - 2 = -2 \). So:

\( f(0) = \frac{-2}{-2} \)

Which simpl \( 1, since both negatives cancel out. So, \( f(0) = 1 \).["end-section"]

["deduction"]Alright, so now I have all three values:

- \( f(-2) = 2 \)
- \( f(-1) = \frac{5}{3} \)
- \( f(0) = 1 \)

Now need to add them together: \( 2 + \frac{5}{3} + 1 \).["end-section"]

["deduction"]Let me compute this step by step. First, add the whole numbers: \(2 + 1 = 3. Then, add the fraction: 3 + \( \frac{5}{3} \).

To add 3 and \( \frac{5}{3} \), I's helpful to express 3 as a fraction with denominator 3. So, 3 is equal \frac{9}{3} \). Therefore:

 \( \frac{9}{3} + \frac{5}{3} = \frac{14}{3} \).["end-section"]

["example-testing"]So, let me double that again.  3 + 1 = 3 \), correct. Then, 3 + \frac{5}{3} \).Yes, 3 is \( to \( \frac{9}{3} \), so adding \frac{9}{3} + \frac{5}{3} = \frac{14}{3} \). So seems right.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, putting total sum is \( \frac{14}{3} \).["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Hmm that the final form? Let me see. 14 and 3 have no common factors besides 1, so yes, \('s the simplest form.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Therefore, the f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = \frac{14}{3} \).["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Wait to make sure I didn't make any mistakes errors, let me go each step again.

For \( f(-2) \):
-umerator:  3*(-2) - 2 = -6 - 2 = -8 \)
Denominator: \( -2 - 2 = -4 \)
So, \( -(-2) = (-8)\/(-4) = 2 \). Correct.

For \( f(-1) \):
Numerator: \( 3(-1) - 2 = -3 - 2 = -5 \)
Denominator: \( -1 - 2 = -3 \)
So, \( f(-1) = (-5)\/(-3) = 5\/3 \). Correct.

For \( f(0) \):
Numerator: \( 3(0) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2 \)
Denominator: \( 0 - 2 = -2 \)
So, \( f(0) = (-2)\/(-2) = 1 \). Correct.

Adding them up: 2 + 5\/3 + 1. 3 + 5\/3 = 14\/3. Correct, that's holds.["end-section"]

["deduction"]I think that's solid. So, the answer is be \( \frac{14}{3} \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{14}{3}}.["end-section"]
