If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\n<think>\n\nFirst, so Julie is reading a 120-page book. Let me try down the problem step by step. figure out how many pages she should read tomorrow.\n\n \n\n want to make sure I understand each part of the problem and calculate skip any any details.\n\nFirst, the book says that yesterday was able to read 12 pages yesterday. Okay, so yesterday she read 12 pages. Then it says that today she read twice as many pages as yesterday. Hmm, so as many as 12 pages would Let, let me calculate that. If she read 12 pages yesterday, today she would read read 2 times 12, which is 24 pages. Got that downSo, the book is 120 pages in total. so I need to figure out how many pages she has left after reading 12 pages yesterday and 24 pages today. Let me add up up. 12 pages plus 24 pages is 36 pages. So, she has read 36 pages so far. Toing that from the total, 120 minus 36 is that me see, 's 84 pages remaining. So, she84 pages left left in her to read.\n\nThe wait, the problem says she she she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read? So, so she wants't have to read all 84 pages tomorrow just half of them.. Let, half of 84 is... let me calculate that.  of 80 is 40, and half of 4 is 2, so , half of 84 is 42.. So, she should read 42 pages tomorrow.\n\nWait me just double to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Yesterday, she read 12 pages. Today, she read twice as, which is 24 pages. So, 12 + 24 is 36 pages.. 120 minus 36 is 84 pages left. She of 84 is 42. So, she should to read 42 pages tomorrow. That seems straightforward add up.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to be thorough. 12 pages times 2 is indeed 24. 12 plus 24 is 36. 120 minus 36 is 84. Half of 84 is 42. Yep, that all correct.\n\nIs, I I can think of it another way. If many has she read each day? Yesterday, 12, today was 24, so that's 12 per day? Wait, no, that today as many as yesterday would So, it's not a fixed rate each day, but rather a on the previous day's So, yesterday was 12, today was 24, so tomorrow doesn't necessarily she'll read 24 again tomorrow. She, she wants to read half of the remaining pages,So, the remaining pages are 84, so of that is 42. So, she of her reading pattern, she just to read 42 pages tomorrow. That, that seems the.\n\nI, is there another chance this could be interpreteded differently? Let me readeread the problem to \"Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\"\n\nSo, yeah, that's straightforward. She12 pages yesterday, 24 today today, 36 total, 84 left, half of 42. So, 's the answer.\n\nI, just me think sure I didn't misinterpret the question. It says she read twice as many pages as yesterday today So, todaytwice as many\" as a common, so 2 times 12 is 24. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively way to think about it: if she terms of equations. Let me assign variables.\n\n model this.\n\nLet P let P is the total of pages she read yesterday. which is  as 12. Then, she read 2P, which is 24. So, total pages read so far is P + 2P = 3P. So, the pages in the book is 120, so remaining remaining pages R is 120 - 3P. Then, but in this case, P is 12, So, R3P is 36, So is 120. Then, she wants to read half of R, which is (42. So, yeah, that's consistent same result before.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't know P, 12, but just to solve it algebraically, let. Let me try that.\n\nLet P let P = pages read yesterday.\n\n Then, pages read today = be 2P. So, total pages read is P + 2P = 3P. Remaining pages would = 120 - "
