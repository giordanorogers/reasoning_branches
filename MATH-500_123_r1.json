      "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\n<think>\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the rectangular (0, 3) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin to \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. Let me try to recall the formulas for this conversion.\n\nFirst, I find r, which is the radial from the origin to the point (x, y). The think the formula is r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). That, that sounds right because it's like the Pythagorean theorem. So, pl this case, the point is (0, 3), so x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging those into the formula, r should be \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = That simplifies to 3. Okay, so r is 3. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the tricky part is be finding \u03b8. the angle. I remember that \u03b8 can be found using the arctangent function because tangent is \u03b8 is equal to y over x. So, \u03b8 = arctan(y\/x). But wait, in this case, x is 0. so y\/x would be 3\/0, Oh, division by zero is undefined. That means be a problem. I need to think about this happens when x is 0.\n\nI remember when x is 0, the point lies somewhere the y-axis. So, in polar coordinates, that should correspond to an angle of either \u03c0\/2 or 3\u03c0\/2, depending on whether y is positive or negative. Since this case, y is 3, which is positive, so the angle should be \u03c0\/2 radians. That makes sense because \u03c0\/2 is is 90 degrees, which points straight up along the positive y-axis.\n\nLet me double verify that. If I is \u03c0\/2, then the point in polar coordinates would (3, \u03c0\/2). Converting that to rectangular coordinates, give me (r*cos\u03b8, r*sin\u03b8). So, plugging in r that would be (3*cos(\u03c0\/2), 3*sin(\u03c0\/2)). Cos(\u03c0\/2) is 0 and sin(\u03c0\/2) is 1, so that gives me (0, 3), which is the original point. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nWait, just to make thorough, are there another other angle that could also give me the same point? Well, in in polar coordinates are typically measured from  positive x-axis and can go around the circle multiple times, but since we're asked to 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0, \u03c0\/2 is the only angle in that interval that points to up along y-axis.So, putting it all together, the is 3 and \u03b8 is \u03c0\/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0\/2). I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap the steps:\n1. Calculate r using r = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). For (0, 3), that's \u221a(0 + 9) = 3.\n2. Determine \u03b8. Since x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is \u03c0\/2.\n3. Verify them and \u03b8 to get the polar coordinates (3, \u03c0\/2).\n\nI, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that when x is 0, the angle is on the y-axis, so the angle is be \u03c0\/2 or positive y and If y were negative, it would be 3\u03c0\/2, but in this case, it's positive, so \u03c0\/2 is correct.\n\nI guess remember to verify by conversion by plugging back into the rectangular coordinates, which is me the original point. That gives me confidence that my did it right.So, I think I'm all here. The polar coordinates for (3, \u03c0\/2).\n\n I'll write that as the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n<\/think>\n\nTo convert the point \\((0, 3)\\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we follow to find \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\).\n\n1. Calculate \\(r\\) using the formula \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine \\(\\theta\\). Since the point \\((0, 3)\\) lies on the positive \\(y\\)-axis, the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the polar coordinates are \\((left(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\n\\]<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"
