Find the number of such sequences $\\{a_n\\}$.\n<think>\n\nOkay, so I have this problem here about a. Let me try to understand it step by step.We have a non-negative integer sequence {a_n} where a first term a\u2081 is 2016. Then, each subsequent term a_{n+1} is less than or equal to the square root of the previous term a_n. Also, if the number of terms is at least 2, any any two terms in the sequence are be different. The need to find the number of such sequences.\n\nHmm, okay me break this down. The, starting with a\u2081 = 2016, each next term is be at most the square root of the previous one. But, a\u2082 \u2264 sqrt(2016). Since since also have the make that all terms are different if there are at least two terms. So, for from a\u2081, each term must to be a distinct-negative integer, and each term after the first must to be different from all the terms.\n\nFirst, let me figure sqrt(2016). to get an idea of the possible values for a\u2082.Calcul(2016) is approximately 44.9, Since a\u2082 has to be a non-negative integer, the\u2082 can be at most 44. But a, a\u2082 must be different from a\u2081, which is 2016. so a\u2082 can be any integer from 0 to 44, inclusive, except 201? 44 is less than 2016, but wait44 is different from 2016. Wait, no, 44 is different a integer, so a\u2082 can be any integer from 0 to 44, inclusive long as it's not equal to any2016, but it can't be because 44 \u2260 much smaller.\n\nWait wait, wait, the condition is that ifif the number of terms is at least 2, then any two terms in the sequence are not equal.\" So, for means all for the entire, all terms must be distinct. So, a\u2082 can be be equal to a\u2081, which is 2016, but since a\u2082 is at most 44, it's automatically different. So, a\u2082 can be any integer from 0 to 44.\n\n inclusive.\n\nSo, but hold on, the_{n+1} \u2264 sqrt(a_n). So, a\u2082 \u2264 be \u2264 sqrt(2016) \u2248 .9, so a\u2082 can at most 44. So, a\u2082 can be 0,1,2,...,44.But then wait the terms must be different, the number of terms is at least 2, so\u2082 can't any of these 45 numbers (0 0). So, \u2082 has be 0,1,2,...,44.\n\nThen then,\u2083 must be a\u2083 \u2264 sqrt(a\u2082). So a\u2082 can at most 44, sqrt(44) is approximately 6.63, so a\u2083 can be at most 6.But again, a\u2083 must be different from a\u2081 and a\u2082. So, a\u2083 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but it can't be equal to a\u2082 or a\u2081.Wait, but a\u2081 is 2016, a\u2082 is between say, between 0 and 44. So, a\u2083 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but long as it's not equal to a\u2082.\n\n a2016. But since a\u2082 is at0- 6, and a\u2082 is 0 to 44, the a\u2082 is, 0 to 6, then a\u2083 can't be equal to a\u2082. If if a\u2082 is greater than 6, then a\u2083 can can to be be equal to 2016, a\u2082, but since a\u2083 is  most 6, and is less than a\u2082 ifif a\u2082 is, than 6), so a\u2083 can be any0 to 6, but a\u2082 if a\u2082 is in that range.\n\nWait, this is getting a. Maybe I need model recursively or use this as a tree where each node branches into possible next terms.\n\nLet, starting from a\u2081 = 2016.Then, a\u2082 can be any0,1,2,...,44. So, 45 choices.\n\nFor each a of a\u2082, a\u2083 can be from 0 up to floor(sqrt(a\u2082))..\n\nBut a\u2083 must also be different from a\u2081 and a\u2082.\n\nSo, for each a\u2082, the number of possible a\u2083 depends thefloor(sqrt(a\u2082)) + 1) - 2, because we have a\u2081 and a\u2081. But, but a\u2081 is 2016, which is way larger than a\u2082, so is at most 44, so a\u2083 is not in the range of a\u2083. So, a\u2083 just be be equal to a\u2082, but can be be equal to a\u2081? No a\u2081 is 2016, and is way larger than a\u2083's which a\u2083 can't be equal to a\u2081 either. So, actually\u2083 just needs to be different from a\u2082.\n\nWait, hold on. the me clarify the condition: \"if the number of terms is at least 2, then any two terms in the sequence are not equal.\" So, in the entire sequence, all terms must be distinct. So, a\u2081, 2016, a\u2082 is some from a\u2081, a\u2083 is different from a\u2081 and a\u2082, a so on.\n\nTherefore, for a\u2083, it must be any integer from 0 up to floor(sqrt(a\u2082)), but not a\u2082 and a\u2082. But since a(sqrt(a\u2082)) is at most 6 ( and sqrt, and a\u2081 is 2016, which is way larger, so a\u2083 just needs to be different from a\u2082.\n\nSo, for each given a\u2082, the\u2083 can be any0, floor(sqrt(a\u2082)), inclusive, but a a\u2082.\n\nSo, but if a\u2083 allowed to be equal0? The problem says non-negative integers, so yes, 0 is allowed.\n\nSo, for each a\u2082, the number of possible a\u2083 is (floor(sqrt(a\u2082)) + 1) - 1 = floor(sqrt(a\u2082)).\n\nWait, because from 0 to floor(sqrt(a\u2082)), inclusive, that's floor(sqrt(a\u2082)) + 1 numbers, Then, subtract 1 because we\u2083 can't be equal to a\u2082. So, it\u2083 has floor(sqrt(a\u2082)) choices.\n\nBut wait on, is a\u2082 is 0, then sqrt(sqrt(0)) is 0, so a\u2083 can't be 0, But a\u2083 has supposed-negative, so it a\u2082 is 0, a\u2083 can't be 0, but a\u2083 can be be different from a\u2082, which is 0. so a\u2083 can to be at else, But if, if a\u2082 is 0, then a(a0) is 0, so a\u2083 \u2264 be a\u2083 \u2264 0, so is only 0. But a\u2083 can't be 0 because it's equal to a\u2082. So, is that a possible here?\n\nWait, if a\u2082 is 0, then a\u2083 must to be \u2264 sqrt(0) = 0, so a\u2083 must be 0, But a\u2083 can't be equal to a\u2082, which is 0. So, is are no possible a\u2083 in That seems't be..Wait, maybe if a\u2082 is 0, then a\u2083 must to be  0, which a\u2083 = 0, but a a\u2083 can't be equal to a\u2082, which is 0, there there, there is no possible a\u2083. So, the a\u2082 is 0, the sequence can terminate at a\u2082.Similarly, if a\u2082 is 1, then a\u2083 can be 0 or 1, But a\u2083 can't be equal to a\u2082,which), so a\u2083 can only 0.Wait, for a\u2082 = , a\u2083 can only be 0.\n\nSimilarly, for a\u2082=2, a(2)1.414, so floor(sqrt(2))=1, So, a\u2083 can be 0 or 1, but can't be equal to a\u2082=2, So, a\u2083 can be 0 or 1.\n\n which since a\u2083 is2, different different the sequence, a\u2083 can be 0 or 1, but  are different from a2, so two\u2083 has  choices.\n\nWait, but for general case, for\u2083 can be 0 or 1, so not of these is different from a\u2082 and a\u2082,Wait, but a on, a the case of a\u2082= 0, a\u2083 can to choices, so the sequence must terminate there So in a\u2082=1, a\u2083 can be 0, so the sequence can continue.Similarly, for a\u2082=2, a\u2083 can be 0 or 1.\n\n so two choices.\n\nWait, the the number of sequences is on whether choices made at each step, with whether the next can continue or not.\n\nThis seems like a problem that we can model it as a tree, where each node representing a term in the sequence, and each edge representing a possible next term.\n\n Then, the number of sequences is be the number of paths from the root (a\u2081=2016) to any possible leaves (where the sequence can't longer continue).\n\nBut this might get complicated because the number of possibilities can branch out a lot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as. Let me define.\n\nLet\u2019s denote f(n, k) as the number of sequences starting with a n\u2081=2016, a\u2082=k, and then proceeding with there.\n\n Then, the total number of sequences would be the sum over k of0 to 44 of f(2, k).\n\nBut then, for each k(, k), it can to consider the number next terms. So, this might not be straightforward because the term depends on the previous one.\n\nWait, perhaps it better approach is to think in the possible sequences as chains from 2016, then each next term is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the square root of the previous term, and all terms must be distinct.\n\nSo, the sequence is determined positive integer (including 0) that is less than or equal to the square root of the previous term, and each from all previous terms.\n\nThis, the from 2016, the can choose of the the sequence step choosing each next term as a non less than or equal to the square root of the current term, and not equal any number.\n\nThis since the numbers can be be of long, but each that each term is non-increasing (since each term is at most the square root of the previous term, which is smaller or the the sequence must eventually reach 0 or 1, because then can't continue further.\n\nWait, but 0 is a, but once you reach 0, the next term must have to be \u2264 than or equal to sqrt(0)=0, so it can only be 0, but since all0 is already been used, the sequence must terminate.\n\nSimilarly, the sequences will terminate at they reach 0, because the 0, you can't have any more terms without repeating 0.\n\nSimilarly, if you term is 1, the next term can be 0 or 1, but  1 is already used, the can only be 0.\n\nSo, all can be of variable lengths, starting 1 term to some maximum length.\n\n they can 0.\n\nBut the problem is, how many such sequences are there?\n\n starting from 2016, with each given constraints.\n\nThis, maybe we can model this as a graph where where each node is a non-negative integer, and edges go from n to m if m \u2264 sqrt(n), and m \u2260 n previous terms.\n\nBut since the sequence must a path on this graph, starting the constraint that all step term is not than or equal to the square root of the previous term, and all terms are be unique.\n\nBut this seems too bit abstract. Maybe I can think in terms of the transitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is strictly decreasing in terms of the values (since each term is at sqrt of the previous, which is smaller), the previous term unless the previous term is 0 or 1), except when 0 can be followed by 0, but since can't have that because all terms must be unique.\n\nWait, actually, no, Once once you reach to 0, the next term can only be 0, but is already to the previous term, so you can reach 0 must terminate.\n\n.\n\nSo, all sequences must eventually when at they reach 0 or when they can't proceed without repeating a term.\n\nBut since each sequence is non-increasing, it each term is a than or equal to the square root of the previous term, the sequence will eventually reach 0 or 1, and on the path.\n\nWait, let me thinkize this.\n\n Let me think about the possible transitions.\n\nStarting sequence is a finite sequence starting with 2016, then each next is a sqrt of the previous, and terms are unique.\n\nSo term is a non integer ( except can be 0.\n\n well.\n\nSo, starting sequence can be a decreasing until it reaches 0, but not reality way way where each term is \u2264 most the square root of the previous.\n\nWait, for the can model of the as a number of finite paths from 2016 to to 0, where each step is to a number \u2264 sqrt of the current number, and all numbers are unique.\n\nBut, but is similar to counting the number of chains chains in a poset where each element is to a smaller element, but with the specific order relation by the square root condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we's similar to counting the number of compositions chains starting at 2016, each next is to a number \u2264 sqrt of), and all elements are unique.\n\nBut I it's better to model recursively terms of the possible numbers.\n\nLet that a sequence must non-increasing, and each term is \u2264 sqrt of the previous, the the can model this as a tree where each node branches into its next terms,But since the size of 2016, this might intractable.\n\n.\n\nWait, but maybe2016 is a specific number, but the we can find the number of the sequence.\n\nNote me think to see what the sequence can.\n\nStarting with a\u2081=2016.\n\na,\u2082 can be any most floor(sqrt(2016))=44.\n\nSo a a\u2083 can be at most floor(sqrt(a\u2082)).\n\nBut a\u2082 can be from so depending number term can dependingWait since instead can model this as a recursive function where for each number n, the can compute the number of sequences starting from n,Let me denote f(n) as the number of sequences starting with term, following the given rules.\n\nThen goal is to compute f(2016).\n\nNow compute f(n), we need to consider all possible next terms m, m \u2264 sqrt(n) and m \u2260 n previous terms. But since the sequence is have all unique terms, m the next term m must be different from n.\n\nBut, for f \u2265 2, the next of possible for m is the number of integers m where 0 \u2264 m \u2264 floor(sqrt(n)) and m \u2260 n.\n\nBut wait, for m \u2264 floor(sqrt(n)), and n \u2265 at least 1, so m(sqrt(n)) is at most n-1 (for sqrt(n) < n for n \u22651). So, m cannot n is, because m \u2264 at floor(sqrt(n)) < is \u2264 than n forfor n \u22652).Wait, for that true?\n\nWait, for n=1, floor(sqrt(1))=1, so m can be 0 or 1.But for n=2, floor(sqrt(n)) is n, so m is automatically less than n, so m \u2260 n.\n\nTherefore, for n \u22652, the number of possible for m is floor(sqrt(n)) +1 (since m can be 0 to floor(sqrt(n))), but since m =, which is't necessary because m \u2264 n.\n\n So, no, m is from 0 to floor(sqrt(n)), which is less than n forfor n \u22652). so m m are different from n.\n\nTherefore, for n \u22652, the number of choices next terms is floor(sqrt(n)) +1 (including m can be 0, floor(sqrt(n)) inclusive).But wait n=0, floor(sqrt(1))=1, so m can be 0 or 1, but m must1 becausesince all terms must be unique). So, for n=1, the number of next terms is 1 (only m=0).\n\nSimilarly, for n=0, floor are no next terms because m(0)=0, and m=0, but m must't be equal to the previous term, which is 0, So, sequences ending at 0 can't have any terms.\n\nTherefore, puttingizing:\n\nf n \u22650: f(0)=1 (the sequence ends here).\n\nFor n=1: f(1)=1 (only possible term is 0).\n\n so then the sequence ends).\n\nFor n \u22652: f(n) = sum_{m=0}^{floor(sqrt(n))} f(m)\n\nWait, is seems recursive a recursive formula.\n\nSo for n, you can go to any m from 0 to floor(sqrt(n)), and for each m, the number of sequences is f(m). So, the total number of sequences starting from n is the sum over all of f(m).\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\n Because when m is to f(m) sequences, but the from n, you choose m, then then follow m, you have f(m) sequences.\n\n So, yes, f total number the sum.\n\nBut wait, actually me test again.\n\n For n=2, the(n) is the number of sequences starting at n, Each n, you can choose to any m from 0 to floor(sqrt(n)), and for each m, the have f(m) sequences starting So, f(n) = indeed sum of m=0 to floor(sqrt(n)) of f(m).\n\nBut for n=1, f(1)=1, as from 1, you can only go to 0, and f(0)=1.\n\nSimilarly, for n=0, floor(sqrt(2))=1, so f(2)=f(0)+f(1)=1+1=2.\n\nFor, let's compute f(n) for small n to see if this pattern holds.\n\nCompute f():\n\nn=0: f(0)=1\n\nn=1: f(1)=f(0)=1.\n\nn=2: floor(sqrt(2))=1, so f(2)=f(0)+f(1)=1+1=2.\n\nn=3: floor(sqrt(3))=1, so f(3)=f(0)+f(1)=1+1=2.\n\nn=4: floor(sqrt(4))=2, so f(4)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)=1+1+2=4.\n\nn=5: floor(sqrt(5))=2, so f(5)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)=1+1+2=4.\n\nn=6: floor(sqrt(6))=2, so f(6)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)=1.\n\nn=7: same(sqrt(7))=2, so f(7)=4.\n\nn=8: floor(sqrt(8))=2, so f(8)=4.\n\nn=9: floor(sqrt(9))=3, so f(9)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)=1+1+2+2=6.\n\nWait, so f(n9)=6.\n\nSimilarly, n=10: floor(sqrt(10))=3, so f(10)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)=6.\n\nWait=16: floor(sqrt(16))=4, so f(16)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)=1+1+2+2+4=10.\n\nWait, so see a pattern here.Looking at the=0:1,n=1:1\n\nn=2:2\n\nn=3:2\n\nn=4:4\n\nn=5:4\n\nn=6:4\n\nn=7:4\n\nn=8:4\n\nn=9:6\n\nn=10:6\n\nn=11:6\n\n...\n\nn=16:6\n\nn=16:10\n\nSo, it seems that f(n) increases when n is a perfect square.\n\nWait, for n between k\u00b2 and (k+1)\u00b2 -1, f(n) is the to f(k\u00b2).\n\nWait, for example, from n=2 to2\u00b2) to n=8 (which is 3\u00b2 -1=8), f(n)=4.\n\nSimilarly, from n=9 (3\u00b2) to n=15 (4\u00b2 -1=15), f(n)=6.\n\nFrom n=16 (4\u00b2) to n=24 (5\u00b2 -1=24), f(n)=10.\n\nWait this a known pattern?\n\nWait, let's check nFor=16: f\n\nn=10:6\n\nn=11:6\n\nn=12:6\n\nn=13:6\n\nn=14:6\n\nn=15:6\n\nn=16:10\n\nSo, so like f(n) increases constant between squares.\n\nSo, perhaps like f(n) is at n is a square,So, perhaps function of:\n\nf(0)=1\n\nf(1)=1\n\nf(2)=2\n\nf(3)=2\n\nf(4)=4\n\nf(5)=4\n\nf(6)=4\n\nf(7)=4\n\nf(8)=4\n\nf(9)=6\n\nf(10)=6\n\n...\n\nf(15)=6\n\nf(16)=10\n\nf(17)=10\n\n...\n\nf(24)=10\n\nf(25)=15Wait, let's compute f(25).\n\nf n=25, floor(sqrt(25))=5,So, f(25)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)=1+1+2+2+4+4=14.\n\nWait, so's't fit the previous pattern.\n\nWait, hold my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, n(25)=4, which is f(2)+f(1)+f(2)=1+1+2=4.\n\nf(5)=f, same as f(4).\n\nSimilarly, f(9)=f, which is f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)=1+1+2+2=6.\n\nf(10)=6, same asf(16)=10(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)=1+1+2+2+4=10.\n\nf(17)=10, same.\n\nf(25)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)+f(6)+f(7)+f(8)=1+1+2+2+4+4+4+4+4=26.\n\nWait, that on, that's .\n\nWait, no, for n=25, floor(sqrt(25))=5, so m can0 to1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSo, f(25)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)=Which is 1+1+2+2+4+4=14.\n\nWait, but think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, for n=25, floor(sqrt(16))=4, so m=0,1,2,3,4.\n\n So, f(16)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)=1+1+2+2+4=10.\n\nSimilarly, for n=25, floor(sqrt(25))=5, so m=0,1,2,3,4,5. So, f(25)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)=1+1+2+2+4+4=14.\n\nWait, so f() increases the to the sum of f(m) for m from0 to floor(sqrt(n)).\n\nSo, the's try to see if pattern.\n\nCompute can:\n\nn(0)= = 1\n\nf(1) = f(0) = 1\n\nf(2) = f(0) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nf(3) = f(0) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 2\n\nf(4) = f(0) + f(1) + f(2) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\nf(5) = f(0) + f(1) + f(2) = 4 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\nf(6) = f as f(5) = 4\n\nf(7) = same =4\n\nf(8)= same\n\nf(9)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)=1+1+2+2=6\n\nf(10)=6=6\n\n...\n\n(11)=6=6\n\nff(15)=6\n\nf(16)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)=1+1+2+2+4=10\n\nf(17)=same=10\n\n...\n\nf(24)=10\n\nf(25)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)=1+1+2+2+4+4=14\n\nf(26)=same=14\n\n...\n\nf(35)=14\n\nf(36)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)+f(6)=1+1+2+2+4+4+4=18\n\nWait, f that correct?\n\n Let, for(sqrt(36))=6, so m(36)=sum_{m=0}^6 f(m)=1+1+2+2+4+4+4=18.\n\nWait, that's right.\n\nSo, the pattern is that f(n) increases when n is a perfect square,So at the values:\n\n it seem familiar.  me see:\n\nf: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,,15,16,,24,25,...,35,36,...\n\nf(n):1,1,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,...6,...,6,10,10,...,10,14,14,...,14,18,...\n\nWait, these numbers(n) values look like the number of partitions or n or something similar.\n\n but not they's a known combinatorial sequence.\n\nWait, maybe f(n) is equal to the2^{k of times you can take square roots until you reach 0}.\n\nWait, but  exactly.\n\nWait, maybe f(n) is equal to the number of compositions or something.\n\nWait, let let it better approach is to note that f recursive f(n) = sum_{m=0}^{k} f(m), where k = floor(sqrt(n)).\n\nThis, this(n) is the sum sum up to floor(sqrt(n)).\n\n f(m).\n\nTherefore, f(n) is be built upally.\n\n we compute f(m) for m from 0 upwards.\n\nSo since this up the way up to n=2016 is be tedious, but perhaps we can find a pattern or a.\n\nWait, let way: the that the recursion f(n) = sum_{m=0}^{k(sqrt(n))} f(m) is similar to the recursion for the number of binary you can take square roots before something.\n\n to the representations.\n\nAlternatively, but perhaps it we think the each time n take the square root, you're halve the number orapproximately), so not exactly.\n\nWait, but me think about.\n\nSup\u2019s consider that function f(n) is built.\n\n For f, is a square, say n\u00b2, then f(k\u00b2) = sum_{m=0}^{k} f(m).Similarly, for numbers between k\u00b2 and (k+1)\u00b2 -1, f(n) remains equal to f(k\u00b2).\n\nSo, the we can S(k) = sum_{m=0}^{k} f(m), then for n in k\u00b2 to (k+1)\u00b2 -1, f(n) = S(k).\n\nAnd, S(k) = f(k-1) + f(k\u00b2).\n\nWait, let, actually S(k\u00b2) = S(k),Wait, let me try:\n\nFor\u2019s define S(k) = sum_{m=0}^{k} f(m).\n\nThen, for n = k\u00b2, f(n) = S(k).\n\nSimilarly, for n = k\u00b2 +1, f(n) = S(k).\n\nAnd continues until n = (k+1)\u00b2 -1, where f(n) = S(k).\n\nThen, for n = (k+1)\u00b2, f(n) = S(k+1)So, S(k+1) = S(k) + f((k+1)\u00b2)But f((k+1)\u00b2) = S(k+1).\n\nWait, that S(k+1) = S(k) + S(k+1).\n\nWait, that can imply  S(k+1) = S(k) + S(k+1), which would to (k+1) - S(k) = 0, which is't be.\n\n.\n\nWait, perhaps my made a mistake.\n\n.\n\nWait, let(k) = sum_{m=0}^{k} f(m).\n\nThen, for(k\u00b2) = S_{m=0}^{k} f(m) = S(k).\n\nSimilarly, for n from k\u00b2 +1 to (k+1)\u00b2 -1, f(n) = S(k).\n\nThen, S compute S(k+1), we have to add sum_{m=0}^{k+1} f(m) = S(k) + f(k\u00b2 +1) + ... + f((k+1)\u00b2 -1) + f((k+1)\u00b2).\n\nBut f(k\u00b2 +1) = S(k), f for all up to f((k+1)\u00b2 -1) = S(k).\n\n Then,((k+1)\u00b2) = S(k+1).\n\nTherefore, S(k+1) = S(k) + ( (k+1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2 ) * S(k) + f(k+1).\n\nWait, that seems complicated.\n\nWait, let's compute S(k+1):\n\n = sum_{m=0}^{k+1} f(m) = sum_{m=0}^{k} f(m) + sum_{m=k\u00b2}^{(k+1)\u00b2 -1} f(m) + f((k+1)\u00b2).\n\nBut is S(k) + ( (k+1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2 ) * S(k) + S(k+1).\n\nWait (k+1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2 = 2k +1.\n\nSo, S(k+1) = S(k) + (2k +1)*S(k) + S(k+1).\n\nTherefore, S(k+1) - S(k+1) = S(k) + (2k +1)*S(k).\n\nWhich implies 0 = S(k)*(1 + 2k +1) = S(k)*(2k +2).\n\nWhich is S(k)= =0, which is not possible case.\n\nHmm, this my my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think that S(k+1) = S_{m=0}^{k+1} f(m) = sum_{m=0}^{k} f(m) + f_{m=k\u00b2}^{(k+1)\u00b2 -1} f(m) + f((k+1)\u00b2).\n\nBut, S(k+1) = S(k) + ( (k+1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2 ) * S(k\u00b2) + f((k+1)\u00b2).\n\nBut, but f(k) for m from k\u00b2 to (k+1)\u00b2 -1 is S to S(k).\n\n So, the number of terms is (k+1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2 = 2k +1.\n\nTherefore, S(k+1) = S(k) + (2k +1)*S(k) + f((k+1)\u00b2).\n\nBut f((k+1)\u00b2) = S(k+1).\n\n So, S(k+1) = S(k) + (2k +1)*S(k) + S(k+1).\n\nAgain, 0 = ((k)1k +1).Which again again possible unless S(k)=0, which is not theTherefore suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need over S(k) with something else.\n\nWait, perhaps's try to compute S(k) step by step.\n\nWe have:\n\nf(0)= =1\n\n S(0)=1.\n\nf(1)=1, S(1)=1(0)+f(1)=1\n\nf(2)=2, S(2)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)=1\n\nf(3)=2, S(3)=4 +2=6\n\nf(4)=4, S(4)=6 +4=10\n\nf(5)=4, S(5)=10 +4=14\n\nf(6)=4, S(6)=14 +4=18\n\nf(7)=4, S(7)=18 +4=22\n\nf(8)=4, S(8)=22 +4=26\n\nf(9)=6, S(9)=26 +6=32\n\nf, hold earlier on, f(9)=6, which is S(3)=6.\n\nWait, so, because for n=9, floor(sqrt(9))=3, so f(9)=f_{m=0}^3 f(m)=1+1+2+2=6.\n\nSimilarly, S(10)=6(9)=6,So, S() is the cumulative sum up to k, but f n from k\u00b2 to (k+1)\u00b2 -1, f(n)=S(k-1).\n\nWait, maybe I's try a table:\n\nLet f(n) and S(n)n : 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,...\n\n17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,f(n):1,1,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,14,14,14,14,14,14,14,14,18,18,18,...\n\n18,...\n\nS(n):1,2,4,6,10,14,18,22,26,32,38,44,50,56,62,68,78,88,98,108,118,128,138,148,158,172,182,192,202,212,222,232,242,252,262,282,...\n\nWait, so S(n) is the cumulative sum ofLooking how the table table, f(k+1) = S(k) + f(k\u00b2).\n\nWait, for example=0: S(1)=2, f(1\u00b2)=f(1)=1, so S(2)=2(1)+ + f(1)=2+1=3.
